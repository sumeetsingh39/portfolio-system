## The Stack

- **Core:** Astro
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Content:** MDX & Content Collections

### The Architectural Decision

For years, React has been my default solution for every problem. If a project had even a hint of state management, I’d spin up a React app. But for a portfolio, basically a static collection of text and images, it felt like over-engineering.

I considered **SolidJS** for a moment as that is also new to me, but **Astro** offered an alternative: an architecture that ships zero JavaScript by default. The promise of "Islands" meant I could write semantic HTML/CSS for 90% of the site and only hydrate the interactive bits with React if needed.

As for **Tailwind**, I usually prefer typed CSS (& CSS Modules), but for a solo project where I had limited time, Tailwind felt like a better option.

## The Mental Shift

Coming from React, the initial hurdle wasn't the syntax; it was the shift in mental model regarding routing and state.

I spent time exploring the docs (which are great) and was amused by the CLI experience. "Houston," their CLI assistant, adds a layer of polish that suggests the team cares deeply about developer experience.

The routing felt intuitive, very similar to the Next.js file system. I set up a `BaseLayout` to handle the global layout (Nav) and quickly created the three core routes: **About, Projects, and Blog.**

## Design System: Swiss Style vs. Dark Mode

I wanted the site to embody a **Paper / Magazine** aesthetic—grid-based, typography-heavy, and objective. However, this is traditionally reliant on high-contrast black-on-white layouts and does not translate well to dark mode.

For a developer portfolio, lacking a dark mode is essentially blasphemy. The challenge was translating that stark Swiss look into a dark theme without losing the "paper-like" feel. I needed a color system that maintained contrast ratios without causing eye strain.

I settled on a monochrome palette with a single high-visibility accent color (`#ff4d00`) to guide the eye:

```css
:root {
  /* Default to Dark Mode first */
  --bg: #050505;
  --text-main: #eeeeee;
  --text-muted: #9c9c9c;
  --border: #222222;
  --accent: #ff4d00;
}

[data-theme="light"] {
  --bg: #fafafa;
  --text-main: #111111;
  --text-muted: #555555;
  --border: #e0e0e0;
  --accent: #ff4d00; /* Works across both polarities */
}
```

To add some flair, I mixed the Swiss layout with a "retro-terminal" feel.

## UX Refinements

A common issue in minimal designs is a lack of direction. The layout was so simple that it wasn't immediately obvious there was more content below the fold.

To fix this, I added a subtle scroll indicator for desktop users.
Sticking to the terminal theme, I also injected system info into the header, displaying the user's IP, system time, and device info.

## Adding the content

The most critical requirement was a friction-free writing workflow. I didn't want to fight with a CMS and add another thing to worry about; I wanted to push Markdown to a repo and be done.

Astro’s **Content Collections** are great at that. Collections allow you to define a Zod schema for your content. If I forget a date or a tag, the build fails immediately.

### The "Obsidian" Integration

I write everything in **Obsidian**. My notes are full of custom callouts (blockquotes with specific metadata). To maintain that, I wrote a small script to parse these callouts and render them on the blog with the same style as my Obsidian vault, but with the site’s theme.
E.g.,

> [!info]
> This is info block

> [!bug]
> This block is for bugs

> [!warning]
> This is a warning.

## Final thoughts

Building in Astro was a fun experience. It let me create a simple blog site in a day. I can also add React components to the site and blogs if I wish to later. The site is fast, accessible even with JavaScript disabled, and was built in a fraction of the time it would have taken to configure a Next.js app.
