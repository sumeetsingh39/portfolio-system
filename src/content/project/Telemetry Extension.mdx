# Overview

The _Telemetry Extension_ is an chrome extension designed to collect user telemetry data. The collected data is used to award points in an internal gamification system.
The extension operates in the background, monitoring user interactions, which is then compared against predefined criteria to allocate points accordingly.

# Features

- **Data Collection**: Monitors user activities such as page visits, clicks, scroll, uploads etc.
- **Point System**: Awards points based on user interactions, encouraging engagement. More user interacts with the webpage and takes time to go through the content and configurations, more points are awarded.
- **Privacy Focused**: Only the points and user ID are transmitted back through internal API. No sensitive data is collected.

# Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core programming language used for developing the extension.
- **Chrome Extension API**: Used for creating the extension and accessing browser functionalities.
- **Internal API**: For transmitting collected data securely.

# Installation

1. Download the extension package from the internal repository.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle in the top right corner.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the downloaded extension folder.
5. The extension should now be installed and active in your browser.

# Usage

Once installed, the extension will automatically start collecting telemetry data in the background. Users can view their points and other statistics on the extension popup.

# File structure of the extension:

```

- **Content Script**: Injected into the target web page to fetch user ID and monitor interactions.
- **Background Script**: Runs in the background to and gets events from `content script`, and compares it to a fetched json.
- **Popup**: Provides a user interface to display points and statistics.

# Extension Flow

- Once user installs the extension and opens the target website, the extension starts monitoring user interactions.
- The extension first fetches the user ID from the web page itself, if user is not logged in, extension does not collect any data and show a message to login on the popup.
- Once user is logged in, extension starts collecting telemetry data.
- Every event is compared against predefined criteria to allocate points accordingly.
- The collected data is transmitted back to the internal API only when points are awarded.
- Extension popup displays logged in status, total points, which criteria points were awarded for and last 20 events.
- Once user logs out from the website, extension stops collecting and deletes all the data.
